v4l2cam
=======

A simple and minimalistic wrapper class handling lower level v4l2 management, and providing an easy interface to v4l2 hardware.
Based on https://code.google.com/p/libv4l2cam/

Can easily be used with openCV, giving more control over the camera than the default opencv frame grabber. 
For example the PSeye camera can be run at 125 fps.
